 * This function will be used as onFulfilled handler for any Promise found in the iterable passed to Promise.all.
 * The goal here is to capture in a closure the index of the current item from the iterable. If we did not create
 * this closure, the captured index variable would be the same one that the for loop updates and thus would always
 * be pointing to the last index in the iterable by the time that the onFulfilled handler is called.
 * However, note that for the resolvedCallback callback we want the opposite. For this one we do want to capture
 * the same variable that the for loop updates so that we have the full count of pending promises by the time
 * the onFulfilled handlers start getting called.
 * @param values The resolving promise values
 * @param index The index of this callback function
 * @param resolvedCallback THe callback function used to check if the "all" promise is complete
